        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          India has a rich history dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization
          (3300-1300 BCE). It witnessed the rise of great empires like the
          Maurya and Gupta dynasties, known for advancements in governance,
          science, and culture. The Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire brought
          Islamic influence, while the British colonization (1757–1947) led to
          economic and political changes. India gained independence in 1947
          under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, becoming
          a democratic republic in 1950. Today, it is one of the world's
          fastest-growing economies with a diverse cultural heritage.
